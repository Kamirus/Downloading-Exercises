# Downloading-Exercises

Purpose: This is just a pretext to write a python script.

(future...) Usage:
	1. Enter an URL of the web page containing links to task-files (or exercises, or lecture slides)
	2. Script will take all links from that page, which:
		a) lead to file with non-html extension (like .pdf)
		OR
		b) href contains some given phrase (maybe: 'zad')
	3. Then it will download these filtered files (into current directory)
